# ECPE 173: Advanced Digital Design
Work for a digital design course at UOP.
Project 1 is just some assembly warmup.
Projects 2-5 build on each other to end as basic MIPS processor.
The final implementation can execute a limited set of core MIPS instructions for arithmetic and boolean operations, flow control, and memory read/write.
