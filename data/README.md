# Data Analysis
Work from a data analysis course.
Mostly R and Python (jupyter).
It seems that most of the submittables have been lost, so this is just a dump of work.


## [Project](Project/)
A group project where we used various techniques to analyze IGN game reviews for bias.
I wrote a web crawler of sorts to gather these reviews and some associated data.

## [Mini challenges](<mini challenge/>)
VAST mini challenges.
We were required to put in a "satisfactory amount of work" on 2 of the 3 and present a report of methods/findings.
